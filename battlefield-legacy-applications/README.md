# Battlefield: Legacy Applications

Let me take you on a journey of maintaining a "mission critical" legacy application, a huge refactoring, and a happy ending. We will come across pitfalls, duct tape, architectural and organizational issues. Although you'll feel a little bit dirty at the end, there won't be any SOAP.

#### Background

This talk is based on my experience of the past 18 months working with [Bulletproof](http://www.bulletproof.net) in Sydney. I inherited an Rails application that had grown from a single purpose app to the company's CRM application, under the pressure of a rapidly growing business.

As if this wasn't challenging enough, the CRM application had been built on top of another legacy Perl system that dates back more than a decade ago. Although these mostly internal applications don't experience much load, they are still very critical to Bulletproof's business. 

## Sebastian Korfmann

Sebastian, originally from Germany, is a freelance Web-Developer with five years of Ruby (on Rails) and Javascript experience. He enjoys combining work and travel whenever possible and spent most of the last 18 months travelling around the world, with an extended stop-over in Australia and Vietnam.

Before he joined the R&D team at [Bulletproof](http://www.bulletproof.net) as a remote-contractor, he was lucky enough to work with and learn from great people at [Ennova](http://ennova.com.au), [9flats](http://9flats.com), [tmp8](http://tmp8.de) and [Ubilabs](http://www.ubilabs.net/en).
