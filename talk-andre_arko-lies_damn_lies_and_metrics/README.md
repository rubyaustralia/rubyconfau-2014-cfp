# Lies, Damn Lies, and Metrics

Rubygems.org provides every RuIn recent years, it's been hard to hear yourself think over the chants of "you can't improve what you can't measure" and "instrument everything". There are tons of companies selling metrics platforms so successfully that they sponsor conferences like this one (or even organize their own conferences!). But there's a problem: metrics lie to you. Metrics just report the numbers that were measured. Analyzing those numbers is up to us, and that analysis can go wrong in so, so many ways. Learn how to arm yourself against human intuition, interpreter pauses, routing, instrumentation lag, and other issues. Don't get so caught up in instrumenting that you lose sight of why metrics exist! Make sure your metrics are telling you actionable information, instead of just accurate numbers.

### Why this talk?

As evidenced by Heroku's "routergate", just having your app instrumented isn't enough to actually know how things are going in the real world. Metrics frequently make people think that everything is understood and under their control, even when that is far from reality. This talk covers common blind spots in instrumentation and metrics setups. It also tries to help inculcate a mindset that cares about the real-world results rather than the dubiously accurate numbers showing up on a web page.
