# Engineering Words

Code is communication.

The more forms of expression we master, the better we can become as developers.
Learning to compose effective prose will improving our ability to express ideas
to developers and to construct better software.

You are already great at using Ruby to communicate your ideas to other
developers, and you use html and css to communicate with people using your site.

I hope to help you become a better wielder of the written word in the form of
blog posts.
