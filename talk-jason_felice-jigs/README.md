# Homemade tools to make your life easier

In carpentry, a "jig" is a tool, often made from cheap plywood, just good
enough for one job. It's used a few times, then thrown back into the scrap
pile to be hacked into another tool the next time around.

In other words, this isn't your Uncle Bob's carpentry.

A _programmers'_ jig might rename 60 source files based on the class defined
in each. Or identify potential race conditions, by determining which globals
are reachable from different threads.

These jigs are code which operates on our code.  As such they hit the really
sweet niche of being fun, throw-away code _and_ built on fun computer
sciencey principles.

I'll talk about several principles and techniques for creating single-use tools.
We'll walk through a collection of jigs in Ruby, Bash, and a few other languages,
and talk about the jig-building patterns we need to keep in the toolchest to
make our lives as devs easier and more fun.

Jason Felice is an XP developer from Cleveland, Ohio (USA).   He's been
coding since he discovered there's no level after 99 in Space Invaders on the
Atari 800, using Vim and hitting the \*nix man pages for twelve years, and
been around more environments (POSIX, Windows, mobile, embedded, web) than he
remembers.

He lives in @maker\_house, a house of nerds and makers in Cleveland's Ohio
City neighborhood. In previous lives, he was a game developer, a full-stack
consultant and the guy who used TDD, software kanban, and continuous
integration to turn around a large code base and a department.
