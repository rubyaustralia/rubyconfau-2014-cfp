# Computing from First Principles...in Ruby

Writing good Ruby is all about creating abstractions. Meanwhile, there are amazing abstractions right beneath your fingertips: electrical signals abstracted into binary signals into logic gates into flip-flops, registers, ALUs, on up.

Let's bring the world of low-level hardware into object-oriented Ruby and explore:

* Building foundational logic gates in Ruby to mimic the hardware
* Using those gates to construct flip-flops and multiplexers
* Using those components to create memory and adders
* Then building fundamental components like ALUs and CPUs
* Implementing fundamental instructions (like the 8088 set)
* Using those instructions to implement algorithms
* Visualizing the whole execution path while instructions are clocked through the system

High-level languages offer us the privilege of ignoring the hardware. But developing a deeper understanding of how the machine is constructed can influence how we design and abstract complex systems.

I am the principal of Jumpstart Lab and have been teaching Ruby since 2005. In 2012 I created and ran the Hungry Academy developer training program at LivingSocial in Washington, DC. In 2013 we relocated to Denver, CO to co-found gSchool. In my undergrad work many years ago I struggled through hardware simulations and Assembly, now I'm excited to show how Ruby allows you to exercise the same concepts with less pain.
