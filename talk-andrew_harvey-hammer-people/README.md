## Hammer People:
### Things I've Learned From Talking to Rubyists

Rubyists are an interesting bunch. Even in our name is an interesting fact: we
identify ourselves by our tool. It's like calling ourselves hammer people.

In this talk, we'll look at some of the things about the Ruby community that
make it a wonderful community and some things that we could do to work on.
Based mostly on stories and from interviews collected in the last year, we'll
be embracing what it is to be a Rubyist, and how that might change.
