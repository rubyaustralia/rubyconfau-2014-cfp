## Search and You Will Find
### Information Retrieval in your web app
In modern applications, search is becoming a feature which users come to
expect. Not only that, having been spoiled by google pouring money at the
problem of search, users expect search to perform well.

Being rubyists and not information retrieval specialists, it can be hard to work
out why our chosen search solution doesn't work like we expect it to. Be it Sphinx, 
Solr, ElasticSearch, Postgres fulltext or `SELECT ... LIKE` queries that's not
always our jam and it can seem a bit like a dark art.

This talk goes into some first principles of information retrieval and at the
other end we will have a firm grounding in how to apply these practically to
whatever search solution you use to improve the experience of your users.

We'll use real-world examples, do some live demos and work through some user
stories in our journey towards better search.

Topics include:
 - Recall vs precision
 - Useful measures of quality
 - Tokenisation and analysis
 - Autocomplete/Typeahead
 - Ranking and scoring
 - Query parsing
 - Filtering
 - Context awareness
