# find-and-remove mysterious fog particles 

Mysterious fog particles are mysterious because, sometimes we can't see them, and even if we see them, we can't get rid of them.

Knowingly or unknowingly we add lot of mysterious fog particles to our code, but often, after adding them we can't get rid of them easily. 

This talk is about, 
* how "we" ourselves add these fog particles to our very own code,
* what are these mysterious particles &    
* how to indentify & remove them,
* thereby making our code much more cleaner and less complex.    
Generally these mysterious fog particles are nothing but our own coding practices, which results in generation of these particles, thereby spoiling our code quality.

So i am going to walk you through different gems (like 'flog', 'flay'), that can smell these mysterious fog particles in our code and the ways they can help us to reduce these particles and ultimately turn a bad code into a good one.
This talk ultimately is - to easily find-and-remove mysterious complexities from our code.
