# Why Ruby/Elixir (culture) can make the difference in Software Development: A Behavioral Economics Reflexion

**Audience:** Rubysts and Software Developers at General

## Description
*Classical Economics* traditionally conceptualizes a world populated by agents calculating, unemotional maximizers bearing the name of Homo economicus. The classical economic ignores or dismisses virtually all human behavior studied by cognitive and social psychologists. The standard economic model of human behavior-realistic three features includes unlimited rationality, willpower and infinite selfishness without limits, all of which **Behavioral Economics (BE)** modifies it in a more *holistic* view based on *evidence* and *experiments*.

Software craftsmanship is an approach to software development that emphasizes the coding skills of the software developers themselves vs the view of practitioners of the well-defined statistical analysis and mathematical rigor of an engineering approach with the connotations of predictability, precision, mitigated risk and professionalism. Dan North wrote: *"No-one wants your steenking (sic) software â€“ they want the capabilities it gives them, and they want those yesterday"*. 

Why Ruby and Elixir programming languages that are designed to make programmers happy have been hypothesized to be more effective in the long run because happy programers are more productive. But this is true? What other factors should be taken in consideration? The BE could offer some light to this based on the findings of the field as:
  * Labor and Motivation: Meaning, IKEA effect, Not-Invented here bias, Cognitive Dissonance, Monetary/Social Stress and Performance.
  * Self-Control: Difficulty with Self-Control, Reward Substitution, Ulysses Contracts
  * Psychology of Money: Cost Opportunity, Relativity, Mental Accounting, Loss Aversion, Endowment Effect, Market and Social Norms
  * Irrationality: Defaults, Preferences, Relativity, Long-lasting Effects of Decisions and Learning from our Mistakes

This principles will be presented in a practical way and how we can take advantage of those to reflect about the relevance of Ruby for the Software Development.

## Presentation Style
The presentation will be very interactive. The presenter will ask the participation of the audience to illustrate at real time and at live the BE principles. These principles will be use for reflecting about the relevance of Ruby/Elixir for the Software Development
