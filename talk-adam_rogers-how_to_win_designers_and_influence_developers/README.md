# My Talk Title

This talk is about ways to hack your team for a more efficient, productive and ultimately happier existence. That's the good news. The bad news is hacking your team starts with hacking yourself.

In 1936, Dale Carnegie published a book called "How To Win Friends And Influence People". You may have heard of it. In 1989, Stephen Covey published "The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People". I was 6 years old.

What can these old books (and others) teach us about working as part of a modern software team today?

A hell of a lot, actually.

We'll look at some of the hacks, I mean techniques, raised in these books and investigate how they apply in the modern software team.

## My Name

I'm a professional yack-shaver at Mint Digigtal. I'm supposed to be a Rails developer. From dotfiles to development tools, there is nothing that diverts my attention more than fixing something that wasn't really broken in the fist place.
