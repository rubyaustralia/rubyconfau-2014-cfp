# Ruby is not for Entrepreneurs

In the Ruby Community there are a lot of Entrepreneurs building amazing things, maybe because Ruby makes developers happy, or because the tooling make you more productive, either way I turned out to be one of them and lined myself up for failure.

This is the story of why quitting my day job and building a distributed Continuous
Integration service in Ruby was a bad idea and where it all went wrong, and how you can stop yourself making the same mistakes even on the project your building right now.

## Ivan Vanderbyl

Ivan Vanderbyl takes everything too seriously, this is why his bio is best kept as: "Tall, extremely caffeinated rubyist/programmer" as that is pretty much what he's been doing for a while; programming caffeine and drinking rubies.

Officially Ivan is the CTO at App.io where he spends most of his time making mistakes while writing Go, Javascript, and Ruby.
