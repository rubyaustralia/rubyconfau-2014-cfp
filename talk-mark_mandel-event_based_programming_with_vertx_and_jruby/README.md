#Event Based Programming with Vert.x and JRuby
[Vert.x](http://vertx.io/) is a polyglot, lightweight, high performance application platform for the JVM that provides a non blocking, asynchronous event based programming model in a simple and scalable way.

In this talk we will look at how you can take your regular Ruby code and Gems and combine them with Vert.x's module system to build a highly concurrent system without leaving your favourite language.

## Mark Mandel

Mark Mandel has been a full time consultant for quite a number of years, and writing software for well over a decade. He built his career mainly on ColdFusion, but over the past few years has been transitioning much of his work over to JRuby as well as dabbling further in various other languages on the JVM.

When he's not too busy coding (at work, or on the side) he enjoys training martial arts in a wide variety of disciplines and reading way too much fantasy literature.
