# Seeking Simplicity

Rails forever changed how Ruby applications are designed and constructed. The flood of new developers gorged themselves on Ruby's flexibilities and structures, DSLing this and dynamically defining that.

Eight years later, many teams and developers are feeling the pain of those excesses. There's an emerging trend of "Less is More" -- less Rails, less ActiveSupport, less RSpec, fewer dependencies, and less code that sacrifices clarity for conciseness.

In this session, we'll look at a few ways that you can cut back and simplify your Ruby including:

* Writing more Ruby away from Rails
* Preferring classes and methods above all other options
* Thinking carefully about when code is read versus executed
* Mastering more of Ruby's Standard Library
* Thinking critically about MiniTest and RSpec
* When is it worth adding a dependency?

You'll leave this session with the tools and motivation to write better applications by keeping it simple.

I am the principal of Jumpstart Lab and have been teaching Ruby since 2005. In 2012 I created and ran the Hungry Academy developer training program at LivingSocial in Washington, DC. In 2013 we relocated to Denver, CO to cofound gSchool. Over time I've grown to understand how dependencies influence our development processes and that DSLs are often more pain then they're worth.
