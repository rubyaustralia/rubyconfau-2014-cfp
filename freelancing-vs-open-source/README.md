# Freelancing and open source

Software freelancing can be a great deal of fun but it can also be all consuming.
The ability to work as much or as little as you need to can lead to extremes in each direction, either at the cost of profitability or at the exclusion of any open source at all.

In this talk I will discuss strategies that I have used to manage my time more effectively and maintain a positive work and life balance.  This will include the tools that I use, the processes that I try to follow and the attempts that I've made to separate the expectations and the disappointments of the open source software projects' users from my personal wellbeing while also remaining interested and motivated.
