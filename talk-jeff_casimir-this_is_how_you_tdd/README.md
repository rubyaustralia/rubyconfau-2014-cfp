# This is How You TDD

Over the past year our organization implemented daily warmup exercises to get your mind engaged in programming without the weight of business processes and deadlines. We've found these exercises to be a great tool to improve our practice, and are growing a community around the exercises with Exercism.io

But there are still so many developers out there who struggle with automated testing. How do you test? When? Is it ok to repeat code? What if the test looks like the implementation? Do I need XYZ magical library to test effectively? It doesn't have to be that complicated.

In this session, we'll pair program on an exercise to demonstrate and explain both our techniques and thought processes along the way. We'll leave you with recommendations on how to get started and how to get good with TDD, along with references to our archive of exercises and community of critiquers.

I am the principal of Jumpstart Lab and have been teaching Ruby since 2005. In 2012 I created and ran the Hungry Academy developer training program at LivingSocial in Washington, DC. In 2013 we relocated to Denver, CO to cofound gSchool. We've been successful in teaching TDD to several classes of students and are excited to share the lessons learned with the RubyConf AU community.
