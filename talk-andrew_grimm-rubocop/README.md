# RuboCop: A Ruby style guide gone executable

RuboCop is a static code analyzer. It analyzes your code to see if it follows style guidelines,
such as those suggested by Bozhidar Batsov's Ruby Style Guide. It also performs linting
of your code.

By default, RuboCop will report problems in your code, but for some problems, you can ask RuboCop
to automatically correct them for you.

RuboCop is configurable. Each guideline is enforced by a single cop, which can be disabled, or
configured to represent a modified guideline.

This talk will cover how to use RuboCop, including configuration, what it can detect,
and how it is useful.

## Andrew Grimm

Andrew Grimm is a bioinformatician at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.
He came across Ruby while using Rails at his previous job associated with the Encyclopedia of Life,
but now specialises in Plain Old Ruby Objects.

He has worked on various projects outside of work. One analyzed why you always end up at "Philosophy" in Wikipedia.
Another was a fork of Heckle in which zombies eat your brains unless your unit tests can kill them all.
At RubyKaigi 2011 he demonstrated the Small Eigen Collider, which generates random Ruby code that can be run under different
implementations of Ruby to check for inconsistencies or bugs.

He is interested in promoting interaction between the Ruby communities of different countries, especially
between Australia and Japan.
