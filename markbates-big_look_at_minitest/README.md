# A Big Look at MiniTest

In Ruby 1.9 the MiniTest testing framework was introduced. This lightweight testing framework is fast, powerful, and easy to understand, yet so many people over look it.

In this talk we'll look at using MiniTest in a simple, non-Rails, project and then work up to using it in a Rails application. We'll look at both the TestUnit and RSpec style syntaxes that MiniTest offers. We'll also learn to write custom matchers, run specific files, and much more.

Testing is important to all Ruby developers, and with such a powerful testing library already bundled with Ruby, shouldn't we learn how to use it?
