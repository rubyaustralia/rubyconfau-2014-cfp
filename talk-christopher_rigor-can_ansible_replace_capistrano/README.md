# Can Ansible Replace Capistrano?

[Ansible](http://www.ansibleworks.com/) can be used for configuration managment like Chef and Puppet. It can also be used for application deployment like Capistrano.  

In this talk, we will investigate the advantages of using one tool for configuration management and application deployment.

Are all the Capistrano features available in Ansible? How do I convert my recipes to Ansible playbook? These are some of the questions we will answer during the talk.
