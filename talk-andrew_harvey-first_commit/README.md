## First Commit:
### Getting into open source

Open source software is a wonderful thing, but it's a daunting idea as you
start out. In this talk we'll look at different ways of getting into open
source and how to do it well.

There will be stories about how prominent open source contributors started out,
and feedback from project maintainers. We'll also take time to cover open source
ettiquette and how to make the most valuable contributions no matter whether
you're a green horn or an old hand.
