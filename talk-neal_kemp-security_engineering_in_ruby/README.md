# Security Engineering in Ruby

Believe it or not, proper application security isn't just for banks or the NSA.
Recent high-profile attacks have cost web companies millions of dollars and
thousands of users. These attacks raise the question, how should you protect your
business and customers? You are probably salting your hashes and encrypting your
traffic already, but there are much more fundamental elements of Ruby application
security that you should employ throughout the development process.

Rather than dive into specifics like what-is-ssl or
what-is-the-most-secure-hash-function, I will cover the most important tenets of
security engineering such as educating your team, identifying attack surfaces,
and utilizing the principle of least privilege--just to name a few. After
explaining why a tenet is vital, I will show you how to apply it to your Ruby
development processes.

This talk is aimed at Ruby developers of any level. You will come out of this
talk knowing the core principles of security engineering and how to bring this
knowledge back and implement on your dev team.

In the past, he has worked as a developer at thoughtbot and ZURB. Neal's composition
is one part developer one part hacker. He has been developing on the web
since marquees were cool, and his interest in security started when he began
exploiting vulnerabilities on Myspace for fun.

He hails from Iowa where he had the choice between yanking
[tassels](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detasseling) off of corn
and yanking lines in VIM. While he has done both, he has decided to stick with
the latter. When he's not writing code in a dark basement, you can find him
cycling, climbing, or travelling.
