# Fast, JSON-API-compliant, and ready for Ember Data

We love Rails. We love Sinatra. We love snappy applications.

[Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) is carrying the convention-over-configuration torch forward from Rails into client-side MVC-land, and a big part of that convention is about standardising our JSON APIs.

The Ember.js data-persistence library, known as Ember Data, implicitly specifies an API that it 'expects' - an API that will require no configuration by the Ember application. [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) is the name given to that specification.

This talk is about demonstrating different approaches for developing JSON-API compliant APIs in Ruby, hooking the APIs up to a basic Ember.js app, and contrasting the performance and maintainability of each API implementation.
