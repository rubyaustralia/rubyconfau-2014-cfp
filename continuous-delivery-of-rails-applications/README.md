# Continuous Delivery of Rails Applications (or "webscale" Rails)

Taking your app from it's infancy, and turning it into something that can serve tens of thousands of requests a minute, is no cakewalk. 

This talk will go through the steps to build a Continuous Delivery pipeline for your Rails Applications. Including:
  - Running your specs and features (of course)
  - Building an artifact
  - Provisioning resilient environments (Amazon or otherwise)
  - Inactive/Active setup, so you can manually "gate" production releases
  - Automatic healing, so you don't get woken up in the middle of the night for minor things
  - Bonus: Suggestions on monitoring, alerting & backups

Geek since birth. DevOp. Ruby Developer. Lover. Idealist. 

While I love doing Ruby and Rails development, I also enjoy building production environments and keeping them running (and all that that entails).

I currently work for [Pop!](http://popanyform.com), a Startup based in Melbourne. Pop! is a revolutionary and secure way to instantly populate web forms and online applications.

In my own time, I'm the proud of creator of http://faxitforme.com  (RailsRumble2012) and http://newsbrow.se  (NKO 2012).
