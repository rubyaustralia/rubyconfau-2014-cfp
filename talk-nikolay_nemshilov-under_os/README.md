# UnderOS

I would like to give a talk about a new exciting project called `under-os`, which is a full-scale browser-like abstraction on top of iOS that uses rubymotion and well, ruby.

It solves a really big problem in a really cool way. Basically, you've got rubymotion, which reduces the hassle of getting into the iOS apps development for rubyists, but it's still iOS, which is very alien to ruby itself and web-developers in general.

So, the ambition of this project is to write a full-scale abstraction in ruby on top of iOS, which will borrow a lot of concepts from the front-end development, like events, templates, stylesheets, etc. But we do it properly and in ruby.

In the end we will have a fully rubyists friendly stack that will be familiar to any web-developer and will drastically reduce the entry level for native apps development.
