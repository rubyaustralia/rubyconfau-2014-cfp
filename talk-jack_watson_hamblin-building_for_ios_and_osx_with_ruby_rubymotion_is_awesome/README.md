# Building for iOS and OS X with Ruby (RubyMotion is Awesome!)

The world of developing iOS and OS X applications can be a scary one. Objective-C is a bizzare looking language for most Ruby developers, Xcode is a complex tool and learning to use all the parts you need can be really hard, and then there is the frameworks... THERE IS SO MANY OF THEM!

We can get past this though, and bring our amazing Ruby skills to make things for those shiny Apple products we love so much. RubyMotion has opened up a whole new world of opportunities, and it's terminal workflow means you get to avoid Xcode for almost everything. All that's left is for me to show you how to get setup, show you the tools, give you an introduction to the frameworks and wrappers we can use, and show you places to learn more.

He has recently begun creating screencasts about his adventures with RubyMotion, and has found a small group of 20 subscribers together to help him get the screencasts focused on the important topics and on important "features" of the screencast, like every episode being done using behavior driven development.
