# GET /better

Becoming a well sought after and "better" developer is easier than you think. There are no tonics or elixirs you can take that will instantly make a desirable engineer, but there are easily defined steps to that goal.

In this talk we will discuss the different avenues that are at your disposal to become a better developer. These achievable steps have led me to a successful software development career, and they can help you too.

This is not a get rich quick scheme, there is sweat and hard work involved, but it'll fun. So let's get better!
