# Concurrency for !Dummies (Who Don't Get It (...Yet))

You can't go to a Ruby conference lately without someone banging on about concurrency and thread safety. You're a smart Rubyist, but... you don't get it. You understand the basic idea, you nod along, but once they get into the jargon, what does it all mean? How does it apply to you, and what is it, exactly? This talk will answer those questions, by engaging in a basic primer on concurrency in Ruby, a discussion of actual examples of how it works, and provide you with answers that will leave you nodding in agreement, rather than nodding off.
