# Rubytus: Resumable File Uploads with Tus.io
Users want to share more and more photos and videos. But mobile networks are fragile. Platform APIs are a mess. Every project builds its own file uploader. [Tus.io](http://tus.io) is an open protocol to fix the mess that developers are facing developing APIs for mobile.

Rubytus is a ruby gem, built by the team at [PicoCandy](http://picocandy.com), that implements the tus server protocol built on top of Goliath, a non-blocking (asynchronous) Ruby web server framework.

Resumable file upload should just work in the 21st century and developers shouldn't have to worry resuming file uploads from their web and mobile apps. In the 45 minutes that Khang has, he will introduce the Tus protocol and talked about the development of Rubytus. Finally, Khang will show how you can integrate Rubytus into your API using [Grape](https://github.com/intridea/grape).

## Khang Toh

In his spare time, Khang contributes to open source projects and [builds stuff](https://github.com/picocandy/rubytus) with the goal of helping other developers.
