# I've got your number: Machine Learning in Ruby

Would you like to do some OCR using Ruby and learn some
machine-learning along the way?

In this talk, first up, we'll have a quick demo where an attendee
scribbles a number on a sticky note and a Ruby program tries
to recognize it. Then we'll pick it apart, covering:

+ the basics of machine-learning (and different applications)
+ brief look into the Math behind supervised learning (classification)
+ (mostly) hand-rolled code applying this Math
+ libraries/tools available to Rubyists (and choice of Ruby platforms)
 including:
   + weka
   + mahout
   + libsvm
   + Ruby `Matrix` class :)
   + etc.
+ ways to dive deeper into ML

You'll leave inspired to explore this new world of machine learning,
pick up sought-after skills and have fun!

PS: To add some variety, I'll employ the widely recognized but rarely
heard (at Rubyconf AU) Indian accent.
