# Fear Of The Class - A Refactoring Tale

This is the story of a brave knight and his struggle for unchaining his village from the claws of The Giant Monolith. Stepwise we walk through his attempts of refactoring a gem to a better object design. While we do discuss patterns and strategies this is more than just ticking off refactoring recipes. This is a pictorial exploration of how we turned a complex frightening code pile into a managable architecture that's fun to work with.

He has enjoyed attending, and speaking at, Ruby conferences around the world. Buy him a beer sometime, and with very little prompting, he will tell you why there should be no such thing as a double-render error, why you should not confuse your models with your resources, and how to play a mean bass in a punk rock band.
