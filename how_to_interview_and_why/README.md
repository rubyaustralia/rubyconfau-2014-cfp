# How to Interview and Why

We do a lot of things right in our industry, but one thing we're really bad at is interviewing job candidates. An interview too often feels like a first date - awkward, strange, and not entirely predictive of what's to follow. There are countless books and websites to help you when you're a job seeker, but what about when you're the one doing the hiring? Will you just ask the same puzzle questions or sort algorithm problems? What are your metrics for evaluating or contextualizing the answers? In this talk, I'll discuss successful practices and techniques to help you find someone who will innovate your business, bring new energy to your team, get the work done, and be someone you'll want to work with.
