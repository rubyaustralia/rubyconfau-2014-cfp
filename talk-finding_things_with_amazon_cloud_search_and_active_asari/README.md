# Finding things with Amazon Cloud Search and (Active)-Asari

Amazon Cloud Search provides a powerful mechanism for adding search to your application…. It automatically scales things for you and indexes your data as you add things. Integrating it with your Ruby application can be a challenge, especially in multiple environments. It has crazy domain names, and requires a lot of glue code to automate spinning up environments, and search operations. Thankfully we have Asari and Active-Asari to make that easier. Join us as we talk about search, tools you can use and how Asari and Active-Asari can make it more approachable when you need to move beyond database and solr based search in your application.

## Lance Gleason

Lance has been a computer nut ever since his dad bought him a VIC 20 in the 1980s. After nearly a decade as a Java developer for companies like Kodak, CNN, and GE, he decided to end his addiction to heavy inheritance, static typing, and coding without tests. These days, he practices clean Ruby living with lots of well-tested code, class composition, and fun dynamic languages as a developer/startup CTO for hire with extensive experience in data science and committer on open source projects such as the Passbook-iOS, Asari and Active Asari Gems. He is known to practice interspecies pair (purr) programming with his orange tabby, Allie, and when he's not writing code, you will find him diving with sharks, trekking through Chernobyl, sampling wine, cheering on the Springboks or perfecting his biltong recipe.
