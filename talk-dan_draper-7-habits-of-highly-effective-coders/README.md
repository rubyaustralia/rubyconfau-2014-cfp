# The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Coders

Inspired by the book, [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](http://www.amazon.com/The-Habits-Highly-Effective-People/dp/0743269519), this talk will cover 7 habits that great coders often employ (or perhaps should employ) when working professionally or for fun.
Covering the technical to the social and the psychological, the 7 Habits of Highly Effective Coders will help coders deliver great code, stay focused, remain highly employable
and maintain a good code-life balance.

Be warned, some of these habits might not be what you expect!

## Dan Draper

Over the years I've lost my hair, been yelled at (read: almost dumped) by girlfriends and forgotten to eat while glued to a keyboard. But I *have* learned some super valuable lessons and I'd love to share them.

I've been coding since I was 12 years old and professionally since my early twenties. I've worked in large teams as well as on my own. I've run three of my own startups, in one of which I managed a team of 10 coders. These days I program in Ruby and use the Rails framework while running codehire.com, a tech recruitment platform.
