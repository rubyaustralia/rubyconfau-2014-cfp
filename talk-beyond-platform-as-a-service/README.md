# Beyond Platform As A Service (PaaS)

When it comes to deploying web applications most Rubysts turn to Plaform as a Service (PaaS) solutions like Heroku and Engine Yard which is cool, but it can limit the gems and external processes you can use. Let's level up! 

In this session I am going to show you how to roll your own IaaS cloud environment for maximum flexibility and control. I will use the popular fog gem to demonstrate how to do the following:

* Create a server
* Configure this server with chef
* Configure a load balancer
* Configure a custom network

Along the way, I will demonstrate how fog works and provide you with a sample template that can be applied to all of your projects.
