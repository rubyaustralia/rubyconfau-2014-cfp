# Introduction to RubyMotion

Hands-on one-day workshop to bootstrap you into developing iOS applications with RubyMotion. We will introduce the iOS system, RubyMotion, then write our very first iOS app.

Requirements: Basic Ruby knowledge, a Mac computer and a valid RubyMotion license. 

## Lori M Olson

After being talked out of vulcanology as a profession, Lori launched into a career in software development, right at the peak of "women in computing". Developing applications and tools for large companies and small, she's been a freelance developer for the last 15 years. A co-founder of the local Calgary Ruby User Society, she's been a regular speaker at conferences in the Ruby, Rails, Javascript and iOS worlds for the past 5 years.
