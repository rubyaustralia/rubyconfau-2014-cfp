# Radioactive Hamsters

Capybara shows up in many toolkits, taking away the pain and verbosity of functional testing.  It's a fantastic tool... But do you know _how it works_?

Let's explore Capybara together!  We'll see the driver lifecycle, learn how the DSL is interpreted, and ~~steal~~learn some of the clever code tricks to use for ourselves.  We'll also look at creating custom drivers, and some of the hurdles faced when extending the Capybara DSL or features.

Capybara is flexible, powerful and full of elegant, clever code.  I learned a great deal from integrating with it -- You will too.


## Dylan Lacey

Dylan still isn't sure what he wants to be when he grows up, but has managed to narrow it down to 'make things and help people'. He's worked in web development his entire career, skipping from test engineer to lead developer and most things in between.  He works at (Sauce Labs)[http://www.saucelabs.com] as their Ruby developer evangelist, maintaining the sauce_ruby gem and Capybarium.

He finds TV too passive and movies too boring, so you can find him playing videogames, keeping bees, planning unlikely hacker projects and having adventures. That's when he's not biting off more then he can chew (excuse the pun) by cooking elaborate meals for his friends, family, and anyone else who gives him an excuse
