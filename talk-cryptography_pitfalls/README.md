# Cryptography Pitfalls

As developers we often do a poor job of implementing cryptography and other security measures in our systems. Often the primitives used are out of date and overlook very subtle flaws. These mistakes lead to systems that are hopelessly insecure despite our perception that we've build an impenetrable fortress. Fortunately there are a few tools and techniques at our disposal that can ease some of the pain. In this talk we'll explore some of the most common pitfalls developers encounter with cryptography and restore some of our sanity.

* Specific topics:
* Misusing cryptographic primitives
* Poor random number generation
* Secure password storage
* Other subtle flaws that can leave you insecure
* Why you should use TLS/SSL and GPG instead
* Learn what a group of researches has called "The Most Dangerous Code in the World"
