# It's business time: how to metric

You can't put a price on data. Great data tells stories about your customers and serves to inform or reinforce the decisions you make about your product. Great data should be readily available, be easy to consume, and be able to answer any question you want to throw at it.

Somebody wants to know how many sales we did last month. You start off with some database queries to get the right numbers. Then you need to make it into a .csv. And wouldn't it be a good idea if we could segment by country? No problem, let's do some JOINs. Then the business people want the data on-demand, so let's put a UI around it and present it nicely. Add a dropdown to filter. And then it's time for the next question. However hard you try, tech debt quickly accumulates, making it difficult to change either your database or the reports you've created.

There's a better way. This talk is a deep dive into what that is, and how to implement that into your application.

In this talk, we'll look at how to determine what the important data is, and how to capture it in a way that doesn't mess with your app. We'll cover how to make data consumers jump up and down with joy. We'll use real code examples to demonstrate how easy it is to get it working. We'll talk about how this approach scales (spoiler warning: incredibly well) and how to manage growth of your product.

Great data that's easy to manage and makes your boss happy is at your fingertips. Let's learn how to unlock it.

Growing up in Sweden, Australia was about the last place Sebastian ever thought he'd visit, yet alone live. After 5 years and counting, however, he has no plans of leaving--at least not until he actually sees a snake.

Sebastian works as a Development Manager at Envato, where he most recently led the development effort behind Microlancer, Envato's latest product. He is a Railscamp organiser, helped out during the last RubyConf AU and is a founding member of Ruby Australia.

Sebastian also dislikes writing about himself in third person, but realises we must all make sacrifices for the greater good.
