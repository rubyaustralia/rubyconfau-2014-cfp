# It's business time: how to metric

You can't put a price on data. Great data tells stories about your customers and serve to inform or reinforce the decisions you make about your product. Great data should be readily available, easy to consume and be able to answer any question you want to throw at it.

The problem is that the applications we build are not well-suited for exposing data. What starts with a few SQL queries quickly turns many. More and more requirements come in, and by now you've written Ruby code to build reports. Then you need to put it in the UI so non-developers can access it whenever they want to. Maybe you have business intelligence people accessing your production data directly. However hard you try, tech debt quickly accumulates, making it difficult to change either your database or the reports you've created.

There's a better way. This talk is a deep dive into what that is, and how to implement that into your application.

In this talk, we'll look at how to determine what the important data is, and how to capture it in a way that doesn't mess with your app. We'll cover how to make data consumers jump up and down with joy. We'll use real code examples to demonstrate how easy it is to get it working. We'll talk about how this approach scales (spoiler warning: incredibly well) and how to manage growth of your product.

Great data that's easy to manage and makes your boss happy is at your fingertips. Let's learn how to unlock it.

## Sebastian von Conrad

Growing up in Sweden, Australia was about the last place Sebastian ever thought he'd visit, yet alone live. After 5 years and counting, however, he has no plans of leaving--at least not until he actually sees a snake.

Sebastian works as a Development Manager at Envato, where he most recently led the development effort behind Microlancer, Envato's latest product. He is a Railscamp organiser, helped out during the last RubyConf AU and is a founding member of Ruby Australia.

Sebastian also dislikes writing about himself in third person, but realises we must all make sacrifices for the greater good.
