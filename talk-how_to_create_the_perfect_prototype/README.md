# How to create the perfect prototype

Prototyping is hard. As a digital agency, Mint Digital has created a number of prototype applications for clients, however these have been some of our least satisfying projects. Whilst we have been inspired by the project and put in the extra mile to delight, things sometimes just don't quite click.

It's taken us a while, and we've been through quite an experience to get to this point, but at Mint, we think we have solved the issue in a way that works for us, for our clients and for the end product. And all it takes is 4 days!

We'll look at the problems that prototypes can face; slippage, lack of focus and bloat. We'll see how our solution materialised out of Mint's company culture in a way that truly surprised us. We'll recap those initial issues and how we solve them and finally we'll look over how Rails helps us as developers and how we can help ourselves when creating prototype applications. By the end, 4 days is all you will need to create anything!
