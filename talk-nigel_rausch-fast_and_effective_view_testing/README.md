# Fast & Effective View Testing

Many people use integration tests to check if an element is displayed or not, which is slow and cumbersome. Others use RSpec view specs, which end up creating duplicated code and scenarios. 

In this presentation Nigel will reveal a better solution. We will review the core problem and then examine a fast and consistent way of testing whether multiple elements are (or are not) displayed, based on a context.
