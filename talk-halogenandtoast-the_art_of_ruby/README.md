# The Art of Ruby

We should all be artists in our craft, but there is a balance between expressiveness and performance. This talk is about finding that balance and producing beautiful code that doesn't sacrifice syntax for speed. I'll explore real world examples of code and mold them into something far more expressive. During the process, we'll take a look at how common design patterns are applied to larger applications and examine the repercussions.

## Matthew "Goose" Mongeau

I've programming in Ruby and Ruby on Rails since late 2004 when the first 15 minute blog video hit the web. Forever changed by brief introduction to Rails I've spent the last 9 years honing my craft. I eventually found myself at thoughtbot where I currently spread the knowledge of Ruby to others by teaching workshops both online and in person.
