# GitHub Enterprise's toolchain

Have you ever wonder what it takes to turn your SaaS into an On-Premise project? At GitHub, we've develop a series of tools to help us build, test and release GitHub Enterprise in a matter of minutes.

This talk is about the internal infrastructure that we've built to support GitHub Enterprise. We'll talk about our testing cloud and how we do continuous integration for an on-premise product. We'll also talk about patterns that we've found useful and things that didn't work out that well. We'll show the tooling that makes all this possible and how it integrates with Hubot to allow the Enterprise team to collaborate.
