# Ruby Robotics

Ruby's great and robots are neat, so we'll start off with a survey of robotics
in ruby and then dive into some specific, fun projects such as:

- Controlling a Sphero and a Parrot AR Drone with ruby
- Using JRuby on Android to control GPIO on the Raspberry Pi via drb
- Building your own full-stack remote controlled robot using drb.

## Josh Adams with Robby Clements

Josh Adams has been developing software professionally for over 14 years,
focusing primarily on web applications.  He serves as CTO for isotope | eleven.
He wrote a chapter for the book _Arduino Robotics_ and is currently porting the
same concepts covered in this talk to Erlang and Elixir.

This talk includes three different hardware demos, and consequently requires two
people to pull off.  Robby Clements worked on these projects with me and we give
the talk together.
