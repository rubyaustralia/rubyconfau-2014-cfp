# Responsible Security Reporting and Disclosure: Why and How?

Zero day vulnerability! Security release! Update now! Everybody hates to see a
release announcement with those words in it, especially when they can't do
anything until the official release is out. As a community, we should learn how
to report a security issue in the right way, and also how to correctly release
a patched version out to the public so that it will affect others as little as
possible.

This talk will cover various toptic regarding security reporting and
disclosing, and why you should do it right. I'm going to talk about how to
report security vulnerability you've found, how to contact the maintainer of
the gem, how to submit a patch discreetly, and how not to do a security report.
For the disclosure, I'm going to talk about how to respond to the
reporter, how to obtain a CVE for the vulnerability, where should you do a
security announcement, and how you should release your fixes.
