# My Talk Title

A blog in 15 minutes is great, but what happens when you're trying to build something truly complex?

Your view code turns to madness, with conditional statements spread throughout.

Your models turn into a complicated series of chained events that are hard to follow and difficult to wrap in transactions.

Your tests are comprehensive and slow to keep your application working.

But at least your controllers are skinny so you're doing it right. Right?

Wrong.

There is a better way, this is just one. This talk is about adopting [Mustache Style ERB](http://warpspire.com/posts/mustache-style-erb/) templates and the [Interactor gem](https://github.com/collectiveidea/interactor) for separating and organising business logic.

## My Name

I'm a software developer from Melbourne, Australia. I grew up Vienna, Austria. People sometimes confuse the two. One day I would like to live in Europe again.

Currently I'm working for The Ferocia in Melbourne on a secret project. Previously I've worked at Clear, NZX and The Conversation. I'm a regular ranter at the Melboure Ruby Group.

I race bikes (Mountain and Road), sometimes I go surfing, and sometimes I'll be hiding behind a camera lens somewhere. Be sure to say hi if you spot me. I don't bite.
