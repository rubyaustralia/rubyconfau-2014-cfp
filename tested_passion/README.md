# Tested passion

We have all heard the technical reasons why we should do test driven development, and we have all heard the burnout stories.

Have we heard the human reasons why tests are good and why a healthier daily schedule including them could avoid burn out ?

We are delicate organic systems that can work nicely if they are respected and used properly. We crash because we do too much. We continually push ourselves to work, deliver and build : we expect and are expected to produce a lot. We forget we are not factories producing tons of product every day. We are machines, biological ones, tailored by millennia of genetic history. Ignoring this, leads to crashes.

What is a proper schedule for our brain to learn and process information? Why can't we stay focused for 8 hours? What is the impact of sleep and naps? What is the impact of physical activity in our daily lives? How does TDD Fit in that process ?

In this talk we will see how much modern workplaces and schedules are disconnected from our biology, how we can change little things to avoid big crashes, work better and be happier.
