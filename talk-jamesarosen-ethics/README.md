# The Ethical Programmer

Programmers have great power to shape our world. Other professions have ethics
boards and revocable professional licenses to bring responsibility to that
power. We do not. Therefore, we must educate ourselves in ethical thinking.

This talk covers methods in ethics both historical and modern. It then applies
those methods to some recent problems. Possible thorny issues include:

 * triage and bug fixing
 * visualization of data: Customer Satisfaction reports
 * features with negative externalities: LinkedIn Intro
 * prioritization: the best minds of our generation optimizing ad-revenue
