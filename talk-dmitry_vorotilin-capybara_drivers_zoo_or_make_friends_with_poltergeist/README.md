# Capybara drivers zoo or make friends with Poltergeist

A lot of developers all around the world write integrational tests using
Capybara. They don't know how it actually works or which driver they should
choose especially when there isn't the single one. We will talk about how
Capybara works and switches drivers, which one you should choose and when and
also we'll consider and disassemble Poltergeist â€” the truly headless driver that
many people use including Travis-CI.
