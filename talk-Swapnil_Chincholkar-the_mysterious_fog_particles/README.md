# The Mysterious Fog Particles

Fog particles are mysterious - they're in front of us in our code and we can't see them! Fog particles corrupt our code and often unknowingly we add lot of them in our code. What's worse is that when we identify them in our "cloudy source code", we can't get rid of them easily. 

This talk is about, 
* What are these mysterious fog particles?
* How do we add these fog particles to our code without realizing it?
* How can we indentify and remove them?
* How can we make our code cleaner and less complex?

Generally these mysterious fog particles are complex code snippets that are generated by our own (bad) coding practices, thereby spoiling our code quality.  I am going to walk you through different gems that can smell out these mysterious fog particles in our code and discuss various coding practices to avoid creating fog particles and ways to reduce these particles and ultimately turn a bad code into a good one.
