#Intro to Graph Databases
Graph databases have increasingly become more popular when operating on highly interconnected data sets such as social network graphs and data powering recommendation engines.

Working with Ruby and some of the more popular graph databases, we will cover the definition of a graph database and explore some common scenarios in which graph databases can really shine over their traditional SQL and noSQL counterparts.

## Mark Mandel

Mark Mandel has been a full time consultant for quite a number of years, and writing software for well over a decade. He built his career mainly on ColdFusion, but over the past few years has been transitioning much of his work over to JRuby as well as dabbling further in various other languages on the JVM.

When he's not too busy coding (at work, or on the side) he enjoys training martial arts in a wide variety of disciplines and reading way too much fantasy literature.
