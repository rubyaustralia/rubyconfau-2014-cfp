# Late to the party: From Java to Ruby

My journey from being mostly Java to mostly Ruby dev. You will find this talk useful if you want to make transition from one technology/community to another. 

We will cover:

 - Where should you start
 - What to do, once you know the basics 
 - Making the transition 

This talk will be particularly beneficial for people moving into Ruby.

## Greg Dziemidowicz

Passionate software developer from Poland. I organise CodeRetreats and internal coding dojos. In February 2013 I have moved to Melbourne and started working as full-time Ruby dev. Before that I have worked as JVM developer in Berlin.
