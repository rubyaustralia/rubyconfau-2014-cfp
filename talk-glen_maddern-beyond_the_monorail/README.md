# Beyond the Monorail: Rails' place in the future of web development

The nature of the web is shifting, and the time where Rails was a one-stop-shop for most web applications has passed. At the same time, the complexity of front-end web development has exploded, and Rails developers are finding themselves only solving one part of a wider problem.

This talk is about the wider web development landscape, where it's headed, and how Rails fits in. We'll look at the increasing demands of ambitious web apps, the new projects Rails developers should be aware of, and which areas Rails and Ruby still reigns supreme.

## Glen Maddern

Glen Maddern's career spans a wide range of web technologies, from distributed backend systems, Rails at both mega-scale (Envato) and startup-sized (Goodfilms), to the latest developments on client-side JS frameworks and front-end performance.

He is excited by the progress of the web at the moment, and sees a huge potential for building applications in new, sustainable ways. While he writes Javascript most of the time these days, his first love will always be Ruby, and he's a big fan of the Rails community in Australia and worldwide.
