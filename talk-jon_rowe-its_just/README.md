# It's just...

"It's just a quick fix"
"It's just software"
"It's just..."

How many times have we heard an employer, client or co-worker utter those
famous last words, "It's just..." this, "It's just..." that, when talking
about the latest change they wish to make to our already creeking or over-
burdened application.

But what if it was?

In the age of Ruby growing pains and monolithic Rails applications, smaller
is better. Let's talk about how breaking things down into smaller units, smaller
services & components brings us benefits. Examine how we can use composition
not inheritance or mixins to build smaller classes, faster tests and better
designed applications.
