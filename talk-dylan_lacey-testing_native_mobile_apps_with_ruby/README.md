# Testing Native Mobile Apps with Ruby
Testing is so ingrained in our culture we have it down to Scientific Formula:  

_Testing + Methods = RSpec_

_Testing + Web Apps = Capybara & Selenium_

_Testing + Native Mobile Applications = ... What!?_

Wouldn't it be great to be able to test native mobile apps using familiar tools and processes?  Yes.  Yes it would.  Which is what tools like [Appium](http://www.appium.io) are all about.
Let's take a course in how Appium makes testing native mobile apps as easy as testing web apps (_psst: It's just Selenium_).  We'll explore how Appium works, how to get your apps ready for testing, and best practices for running mobile tests.

Dylan still isn't sure what he wants to be when he grows up, but has managed to narrow it down to 'make things and help people'. He's worked in web development his entire career, skipping from test engineer to lead developer and most things in between.

He finds TV too passive and movies too boring, so you can find him playing videogames, keeping bees, planning unlikely hacker projects and having adventures. That's when he's not biting off more then he can chew (excuse the pun) by cooking elaborate meals for his friends, family, and anyone else who gives him an excuse
