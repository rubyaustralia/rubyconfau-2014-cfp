# The transformation priority premise, for productive TDD

Almost all of us, ruby programmers, have understood the importance of the TDD discipline. The practice of TDD, however, isn't as straightforward as we would like. We frequently get stuck, not knowing what to test next, and how or when to generalize the code.

In this talk, I will introduce the Transformation Priority Premise, and show how we can use a little mathematical rigour to infer our testing paths, thus reducing or completely eliminating impasses.

## Andre Bernardes

I've been playing with ruby and rails since '08, and doing it for a living for 2 years. I've always been a little obsessed with TDD and coding disciplines in general.
