# Adventures in Creating a Career

As developers, we're required to be on the very edge of technological innovation to remain competitive and relevant. Managing our technical skills is just something we need to do. But what about managing our careers? How do we put ourselves in the position to take advantage of opportunities without being taken advantage of ourselves? In this talk, Sean will detail lessons learned through his own experiences during his 20-year development career in the hope that you can avoid some of his mistakes.

Sean began programming on his friend's Commodore 64 back before you were wearing short pants. His first job was writing tape backup utilities for IBM System 36 at Northeastern University. Today he's a Professional Expert Generalist, specializing in process improvement and automation. When he's not trying to make things better for others through technology, he can be found encouraging his children to explore, create, and to pick up their toys.
