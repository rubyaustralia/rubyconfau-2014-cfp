# Programming Elixir: The magic of today's tonic

Elixir is a new arrival on the programming language scene but many of the features that have Rubyists talking about it are actually old favourites for functional fans. Pragmatic Programmer Dave Thomas has lauded the open-source language as a means of demonstrating functional programming concepts without being overly academic. Influenced by Ruby and Clojure, the dynamic language takes advantage of the battle-hardened Erlang ecosystem to simplify the creation of concurrent, distributed applications -- all with functional flair. This presentation will examine the spellbinding elements of Elixir and how developers can use them for their own sprinkling of open sorcery.
