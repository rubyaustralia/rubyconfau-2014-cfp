# Dear Everyone: Let's Contribute to Open Source!

Hey You. Yes You. How long has it been since you started using Ruby? It has
been a while, right? And you think it's time for you to giving back to the
community, right? Great, let's talk!

In this talk, we'll discuss about the ultimate question: "How can I contribute
to an Open Source". I'll tell you about how to properly started contributing to
a project, how to find something to do, how to write a good patch that will
make the maintainers fall in love with you (or, say, merge your patch in), and
what not to do while submit your patches. Also, if you have your own gem, I'm
going to talk about what you should do to make the contribution process easier,
lowering the barrier to entry, and how to make the contributor constantly
contributing to your project.
